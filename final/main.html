            <h2>welcome to our hotel</h2>
            <p>Located in a fortress built for the surveillance
              of the Bay of Palma, Cap Rocat posed a great challenge in term
              s of its restoration, which involved transforming the facilities
              into a hotel as well as complying with the strict regulations
               governing a building declared a Heritage Asset and listed
                as a National Monument. The fortress lies within a Protected
                Natural Area and blends perfectly into the landscape. Cap Rocat
                 has been completely renovated by Antonio Obrador with the utmost
                  respect for its unique architecture and its natural surroundings.
                   The project has received the Europa Nostra Award, among
                    other accolades.</p>

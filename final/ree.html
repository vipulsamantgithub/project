            <h2>BEST BEDS AND MATRESS</h2>
            <p>The hotel company created its signature Westin Heavenly
               Bed with Simmons almost 20 years ago and hasn’t looked
                back since. The mattresses have a plush, pillowy top
                that provides support while remaining oh-so-comfy. Plus,
                guests can rest their head on a pillow filled with a half-feather,
                 half-down combination just begging you to
              rest your head on it, then cozy up under a down blanket.</p>
